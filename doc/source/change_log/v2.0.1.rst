.. _whatsnew_201:

Version 2.0.1
---------------

- New: :func:`Pipeline.build`
    This function just essentially calls :func:`get_estimator`, but may be more intuitive
    to some to have it be accessible via the :class:`Pipeline` classes.

- New: :func:`BPtEvaluator.subset_by`
    Post stratifying / splitting results by different subsets of subjects, i.e., by sex,
    can be a useful tool in performing post-hoc diagnostic tests on models. This new
    method and outputted classes tries to make this process easier.

- Changed: train_indices and val_indices in :class:`BPtEvaluator` to train_subjects and val_subjects
    This change was made so that parameter names can be more consistent with the :ref:`Subjects` style input
    and other naming schemes.

- Minor Improvement: Added warning when invalid extra_params passed
    Now when extra params are passed to functions like :func:`evaluate` if the
    keys don't line up with any valid parameters, a warning will be issued.

- Minor Improvement: Can now pass single model to :class:`Pipeline`
    Before you had to pass steps as a list, but now :class:`Pipeline` will
    accept a single model-like step as input.

- Updated: Predicting Sex Example
    Added some more examples of using different more advanced features.
