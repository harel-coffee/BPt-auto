Version 2.1.0
---------------

- Modified :func:`get_estimator` for default pipeline 
    :func:`get_estimator` and the associated :class:`Pipeline`
    build function have been updated to allow default
    dataset w/ warnings.

- Modified :func:`Piece.build` function for :class:`Pipeline` pieces.
    Now allows for dataset of 'default' to be passed, and will trigger
    warnings in cases where specific scopes have been passed.

- Added more verbosity to :class:`Pipeline` and :class:`ParamSearch`
    In both cases, the verbosity options have been updated with more useful information.
    Pipeline was switched to a boolean verbosity flag to match the sklearn Pipeline,
    and the SearchCV is left more flexible, but now more output will appear.

- Update Nevergrad Version
    Update to a later version of nevergrad, which fixes some
    pickling issues for 'ChoiceTag', code and tests are changed accordingly.
    Bumps hard version requiriment from nevergrad==0.4.3 to nevergrad==0.4.3.post4.
