Version 2.1.0
---------------

- Bug Fix cv='test'
    - Fixed important bug with :func:`evaluate` and passing
      cv = 'test', had errors with named index. Also added 
      new extra tests for cv='test'.

- Modified :func:`get_estimator` for default pipeline 
    - :func:`get_estimator` and the associated :class:`Pipeline`
      build function have been updated to allow default
      dataset w/ warnings.

- Modified :func:`Piece.build` function for :class:`Pipeline` pieces.
    - Now allows for dataset of 'default' to be passed, and will trigger
      warnings in cases where specific scopes have been passed.

- Added more verbosity to :class:`Pipeline` and :class:`ParamSearch`
    - In both cases, the verbosity options have been updated with more useful information.
    - Pipeline was switched to a boolean verbosity flag to match the sklearn Pipeline,
      and the SearchCV is left more flexible, but now more output will appear.

- Update Nevergrad Version
    - Update to a later version of nevergrad, which fixes some
      pickling issues for 'ChoiceTag', code and tests are changed accordingly.
    - Bumps hard version requirement from nevergrad==0.4.3 to nevergrad==0.4.3.post4.
