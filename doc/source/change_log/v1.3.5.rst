.. _whatsnew_135:

Version 1.3.5
-----------------

- GridSearchCV support
    - Added new abstract BPtSearchCV class.
    - Added in if search_type = 'grid' will try and convert parameters
      to grid search compatible, and use on the backend sklearn's GridSearchCV.
    - n_jobs will propagate correctly.

- Replaced LGBM with BPtLGBM
    - Replaces LGBMRegressor and Classifier with BPtLGBMRegressor and BPtLGBMClassifier.
    - These classes act as wrappers which automatically pass categorical features to the LGBM fit.
    - These classes also allow setting parameters 'early_stopping_rounds' and 'eval_split'.

- Update Nevergrad version
    - Update to nevergrad version 0.4.2.post5
    - Warning: The list of available search types may be a little out of date.

- New CV_Split class
    - This can be used for passing single splits

- New parameter fix_n_wrapper_jobs for Loader
    - This parameter allows setting a fixed number of jobs for the Loading Wrapper.
    - In the future a better system for fixing n_jobs may be added.

- Fix/Change internal representation for Scope Models + Transformers
    - Introduce new internal classes for ScopeModel + ScopeTransformer.
    - These classes fixed a few existing bugs, and should make behavior moving forward more consistent.

- Fix bug with Loader transform_df
    - Fixed a bug with the transform_df function for Loaders.
    - This resulted in a error with computing feature importances for data loaded with a Loader.

- Better pipeline names
    - When using sklearn verbose, or inspecting models, a few names have been changed to look better / be more informative.
