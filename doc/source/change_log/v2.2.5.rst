Version 2.2.5
---------------

- Update docs / examples
    - All full examples have been re-run
    - Some updates made the user guide section of documentation

- Add support for google collab
    - Detect if in google collab, and use correct progress bar

- Change default gb pipeline
    - Kind of funky behavior before, where gb pipe would use lgbm if avaliable, switch to always using hist gradient boosting from sklearn for that default.

- Change default regression scorer to R2
    - Change from explained_variance default to R2 default.
