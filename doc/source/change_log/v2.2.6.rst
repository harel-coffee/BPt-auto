Version 2.2.6
---------------

- NaN support in :class:`Loader`
    - Loaders with will now support propegating any found NaN' with the same shape as the rest of the loaded data files.
    - Will support 'single' and 'all' behavior, tests added to confirm.

- Cosmetic change from role name 'data' to 'input data'
    - All methods will still work when passed 'data' indefinetly, but internally, and for display, switch to having the role key as 'input data' instead.

- Fix bug with permutation testing
    - Block structure and custom scopes will now work together better.

- Fix bug in :func:`Dataset.update_data_file_paths`
    - Now handles NaN case.

- Tweaks to input parameters
    - Just allow more options when init'ing :class:`CV`, :class:`ProblemSpec` and :class:`ParamSearch`.

- Removed MLP
    - Why are you using MLP? Don't, it just isn't good. Sorry, gone, poof.

- New experimental color options
    - Messing around with option for coloring output for :class:`Compare` summary, but still broken for now.
