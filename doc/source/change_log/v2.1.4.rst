.. currentmodule:: BPt

Version 2.1.4
---------------

- Updated :class:`Ensemble`
  The ensemble object can now automatically accept
  instances of :class:`BPtPipeline` directly to its `models` parameter. Before,
  these had to be wrapped in a :class:`Model`.

- Updated :class:`extensions.ThresholdNetworkMeasures`
  Updated and fixed some logic errors when thresholding in the extensions thresholded network object.
  Also added additional tests for the these new features. Moving forward this object should be more robust and reliable.
