Why BPt?
***********

BPt seeks to integrate a number of lower level packages towards providing a higher level package and user experience. 
The key point of interest here is that BPt is designed specifically for performing neuroimaging based machine learning.
Towards this end, it builds upon and offers augmented capabilities for core libraries pandas and scikit-learn (as well as others).
A central goal of the library is to automate key pieces of the workflow, with a large array of default behaviors and pipelines, as well as
always also allowing the user full control. This package works to reduce the barrier of entry as ultimately using machine learning
as a research tool should not be restricted only to domain experts.
