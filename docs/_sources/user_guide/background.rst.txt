.. currentmodule:: BPt


BPt is a Python 3.7+ based package that is tested regularly across all common operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux).
Use of this package will therefore at the minimum require some proficiency and experience with Python and in setting up Python libraries.
Prior experience with the standard data science python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) is encouraged but not strictly required. 
ikewise, some prior background knowledge on both neuroimaging and machine learning is expected as BPt tutorial material is not designed to
be a user's first exposure to these topics. 

For new users, it is recommended that the library be used within a computation notebook (e.g., jupyter notebook or google colab).
These environments allow for an interactive and iterative approach to coding which is highly recommended when learning and exploring a new library or toolbox.
Likewise, most available tutorial material is provided in this base format.

The larger question, in which the BPt is designed to guide the user in, is how to structure and answer a question of interest within a predictive framework.
