Version 2.0.0
---------------

- Big Change: New :class:`Dataset` class
    - This new Dataset class is designed to fully replace the old system of loading via the BPt_ML class.
    - This new system is designed to be more flexible than the old system.
    - Most of the old functionality is ported over, and various new functionality added.

- Big Change: New evaluate method
    - Instead of previous BPt_ML.Evaluate, now various function are provided instead e.g., :func:`evaluate`
    - Introduce new returned flexible class from :func:`evaluate` called :class:`BPtEvaluator`. 

- Updates to the project documentation
    - With replacing the BPt_ML class, large amounts of the documentation was replaced and updated.
    - Moved to new pandas style documentation.

- Class name changes
    - Input classes with _'s have been replaced with versions without underscores, e.g.,
      Problem_Spec to :class:`ProblemSpec`.

- Better support with sklearn
    - Now a number of functions can be passed also in native scikit-learn style syntax.

- More tests
    - More tests across all pieces of the project.
    - Changed from nosetests to pytest.
    - Added github actions CI to automatically run tests.

- Removed Values_Subset class
    - Now the ValueSubset class replaces this functionality, and more generally the
      feature of creating overlaps of column values on the fly is depreciated.

- Removed AutoGluon support
    - Too difficult to manage dependencies, removed for now this previous feature.

- More!
    - Given the scope of this update, not all of the changes and fixes can be listed here.
