- The Brain Predictability toolbox (BPt) is a Python based Machine Learning library designed for working with Neuroimaging data. This library is particularly suited towards working with large neuroimaging datasets, where a large number of subjects with potentially multi-modal data are available.

- Please check out the project documentation at:
<https://sahahn.github.io/BPt/>

- This library is based on python and likely will require atleast some prior experience with python and machine learning.
