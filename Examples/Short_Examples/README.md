## Loading Fake Timeseries Surface Data

This notebook is designed to explore some functionality with loading DataFiles and using Loaders. This example will require some extra optional libraries,
including nibabel and nilearn! Note: while nilearn is not imported, when trying to import SingleConnectivityMeasure, if nilearn is not installed, this will give an ImportError.
We will also use fake data for this example - so no special datasets required!
