The best way for most users to contribute is to help identify bugs and other smaller issues (e.g., if a piece of documentation is unclear).
Once found, an issue should be opened which explains the bug or comment.

If interested in helping to develop the project, that would also be greatly appreciated!
In that case please reach out expressing interest (sahahn@uvm.edu) and we can discuss next steps.
